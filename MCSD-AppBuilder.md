# [<](README.md) MCSD: App Builder

Aim: [MCSD: App Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsd-app-builder-certification.aspx)

I have been working towards this goal for a while and making good progress. I only need a single exam to complete it. I have chosen to focus around the Azure technologies as that is where I would like to develop an expertise.

To achieve the goal:

* [Exam 70-487: Developing Microsoft Azure and Web Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-487.aspx) - ACHIEVED

* [MCSA: Web Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-web-applications-certification.aspx) - ACHIEVED

## Summary

I have now completed the exams required for this certification. In all honesty the `Developing Microsoft Azure and Web Services` exam was straightforward and I did little revision. If you are doing something every day anyway then you already know it, however this was a good way of confirming that to myself and showing good understanding.
