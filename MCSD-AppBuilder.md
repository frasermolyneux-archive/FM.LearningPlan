Aim: [MCSD: App Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsd-app-builder-certification.aspx)

I have been working towards this goal for a while and making good progress. I only need a single exam to complete it. I have chosen to focus around the Azure technologies as that is where I would like to develop an expertise.

To achieve the goal:

  * Creating and Consuming Web API-based services (20-25%)
